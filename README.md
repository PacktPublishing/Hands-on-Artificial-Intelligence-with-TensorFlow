## About the Video Course
TensorFlow is one of the most commonly used frameworks for Deep Learning and AI. This course will be your guide to understand and learn the concepts of Artificial intelligence by applying them in a real-world project with TensorFlow. 
This course will show you how to combine the power of Artificial Intelligence and TensorFlow to develop some exciting applications for the real world. This course will take you through all the relevant AI domains, tools, and algorithms required to build optimal solutions and will show you how to implement them hands-on. You will then be taken through techniques such as reinforcement learning, heuristic searches, neural networks, Computer Vision, OpenAI Gym, and more in different stages of your application. This course will show you how to implement AI practically using TensorFlow models and how it eases the way you interact with the technology. 
You will learn how TensorFlow can be used to analyze a variety of data sets and will learn to optimize various AI algorithms. By the end of the course, you will have learned to build intelligent apps by leveraging the full potential of Artificial Intelligence with TensorFlow.
